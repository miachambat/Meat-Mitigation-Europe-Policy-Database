It also regulates the access of electricity from renewable sources to the grid and contains provisions for the support of electricity from renewable sources. It stipulates that the costs of feed-in tariff schemes are borne by the electricity consumers. The grid operator is not obliged to connect a renewable energy plant if he can prove that grid capacity is insufficient or that the security of supply is at risk. The grid operators are obliged to grant access only if the annual grid capacity limits have not yet been reached. These capacity limits are set annually by the regulatory authority with a relation to a fulfilment of NREAP.

Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordite climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited). The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.

119;211004416;National Climate Change Plan / Climate Protection Policy;Czechia;CZ;CZE;Country;The Czech government adopted a National climate change plan comprising both mitigation and adaptation measures in 2004. The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and mage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to Regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalition plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalition plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

It reflects the new National Energy Strategy, aiming to fulfil Portugal 2020 targets. The estimate of savings induced by PEE 2016 is 1501 ktoe, corresponding to a reduction of energy consumption of approximately 8.2% relative to the average consumption in the period between 2001 and 2005, which approximates the indicative target set by the European Union of 9% energy savings by 2016. The establishment of the time horizon of 2020 for the purpose of monitoring and controlling the estimated impact on the primary energy consumption allows to foresee in advance the fulfilment of the new targets set by the EU, the 20% reduction of primary energy consumption by 2020, as well as the goal assumed by the Government to reduce the primary energy consumption by 25% in 2020 and achieve energy savings equivalent to 30% of the energy consumption in public buildings by 2020.

The key measures to achieve the targets are: An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial  support for offshore wind will also be considered. Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities. New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards.

In agriculture, the SNBC aims to achieve a 12% reduction in emissions through the implementation of the agroecology project. This will involve methanisation, ground cover, maintaining pastureland, developing the agroforestry sector and optimising the use of inputs. In the industrial sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 24% emissions reduction, notably by improving energy efficiency, which is also a source of competitiveness, growing the circular economy (reuse, recycling, energy recovery, etc.) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In the waste management sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 33% reduction in emissions, by reducing food waste, developing the concept of eco-design, fighting planned obsolescence, promoting reuse and improving waste recovery efforts.""";2015;;https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/eo13514_fleethandbook.pdf;CPDB;Cross-Sectoral: Governance;Agriculture, Buildings, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, LULUCF, Transport, Waste;Air Pollution, Economic Development, Food Waste, Mitigation, Nutrition and Health;Producer-oriented

This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include: • Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation; • Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity; • Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation; • Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management; • Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, Sustainable forest policies; • Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues); • Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%; • Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020. The settlement includes three main targets: • In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10% • Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030 • By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action) While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.";2012;;https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/de_fil_necp_main_en.pdf;CPDB;;Agriculture, Buildings, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, Food Industry, LULUCF, Transport;Air Pollution, Economic Development, Food Safety, Food Security, Mitigation;Consumer-oriented, Producer-oriented

The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transport…) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium’s climate strategy: • Energy production optimisation • Efficient use of energy • Industrial sector initiatives • Development of Sustainable transport • Prioritisation of Sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems • Continued efforts in waste management • Increased climate change research • Awareness-raising on climate change mitigation options • Increased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissions • Use of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM) • Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012). Since 2013, the National Climate Commission has been engaged in extending this Plan up to 2020, a process slowed down by the lack of agreement among the regions and the National government on burden-sharing of non-ETS targets for 2013 ? 2020 as well as the share of renewable energies per region.;2002;;http://www.energycodes.gov/;CPDB;Cross-Sectoral: Governance;Agriculture, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, Industry, LULUCF, Transport, Waste;Economic Development, Mitigation;Producer-oriented

""EU energy security has also to be seen in the context of growing energy demand worldwide, which is expected to increase by 27% by 2030, with important changes to energy supply and trade flows. Moderating energy demand is one of the most effective tools to reduce the EU's exterl energy dependency and exposure to price hikes. The current situation adds urgency to the previously agreed EU energy efficiency target of 20% that will result in 371 Mtoe primary energy savings in 2020 compared to projections."" ""Energy demand in the building sector, responsible for about 40% of energy consumption in the EU and a third of natural gas use could be cut by up to three quarters if the renovation of buildings is speeded up."" ""In March 2014, the European Council conclusions called for: ""Speedy implementation of all the measures to meet the target of achieving interconnection of at least 10 % of their installed electricity production capacity for all Member States”. Currently, the average interconnection level stands at about 8%. Taking into account the importance of interconnectors for strengthening security of supply and the need to facilitate cross-border trade, the European Commission proposes to extend the current 10% interconnection target to 15% by 2030 while taking into account the cost aspects and the potential of commercial exchanges in the relevant regions."" ""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU Final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030."" ""Coal and lignite's CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.""

375;1078;The Co-operation Agreement on the National Climate Plan and the National Climate Plan;Belgium;BE;BEL;Country;The present co-operation agreement was the basis for the elaboration of the first National Climate Plan (2009-2012), as well as establishment of the National Climate Commission. The Plan offers a detailed description of all existing formally approved climate change related measures for each sector (energy, industry, transport) and cross-cutting issues (awareness-raising, exemplary role of the federal Government, etc.). The National Climate Plan also defines the 11 main axes of Belgium's climate strategy:   Energy production optimisation</li> Efficient use of energy</li> Industrial sector initiatives</li> Development of Sustainable transport</li> Prioritisation of Sustainable management of agricultural and forest ecosystems</li> Continued efforts in waste management</li> Increased climate change research</li> Awareness-raising on climate change mitigation options</li> Increased direct initiative of public authorities in reducing the GHG emissions</li> Use of flexibility mechanisms (JI, CDM)</li> Integrating the climate dimension into development aid policy</li></ul> Climate change policy has been consolidated in the National Climate Plan (2009-2012). Since 2013, the National Climate Commission has been engaged in extending this Plan up to 2020, a process slowed down by the lack of agreement among the regions and the National government on burden-sharing of non-ETS targets for 2013 - 2020 as well as the share of renewable energies per region.  The Agreement establishes a National Climate Commission which monitors the implementation of the co-operation agreement, co-ordites interl climate policy, and monitors and evaluates the National Climate Plan implementation and fulfilment of reporting obligations to the European and international level. The main tasks of the Commission thus include:   Approval of official reports under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and EU Directives and Decisions</li> Evaluation of co-ordition and co-operation between the federal and interRegional level on implementation of policies and measures adopted on the basis of the National Climate Plan.</li> Advice to the Co-orditing Committee for international Environmental Policy and the Interdepartmental Commission for Sustainable Development.</li></ul>;2009;"Institutions , Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Redd+ And Lulucf;Transport";https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbElNIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--6ef2841e9b338b4853af15fc511c64973f22baf5/L%C3%A9gislation-Accord%20de%20coop%C3%A9ration-Plan%20climat.pdf|fr;CPR;Cross-Sectoral: Governance, Cross-Sectoral: Information Education and Research;Agriculture, Energy, Industry, LULUCF, Transport, Waste;Mitigation;Producer-oriented

The bylaws issued on the basis of the Spatial Planning Act lay down the standards of urban planning and development of land.  Based on the Spatial Planning Act was developed the National Concept for Spatial Development for 2013-2025 (5 November 2012), which outlines the directions for land-use planning, Governance and protection of the National territory and creates preconditions for spatial orientation and coordination of sectorial policies. The main objective of the Concept is 'spatial co-ordition of the processes in the National territory through establishing a spatial and land-use planning base and a regulator for implementation of both Regional planning and individual socio-economic sectoral planning at the National level in the context of the common European spatial development for the purposes of achieving complex integrated planning'. The Concept integrates climate change mitigation and adaptation concerns, especially through considering among the major directions of development of the agrarian and forestry sector 'Sustainable use and management of natural resources - promotion of practices contributing to adaptation to climate change and compatible with protection and improvement of the environment, natural resources, soils and genetic diversity', taking into account the GHG emissions reduction potential of forests, as well as the importance of spatial planning for improving climate adaptation capacity (e.g. reduction of occurrence of natural disasters).;2012;"Adaptation;Institutions , Administrative Arrangements;Redd+ And Lulucf";https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBbjRLIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--fd01878cf290d7cb2c51d845f8bf1c7667a402cb/1110translation.pdf|en;CPR;;Agriculture, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), LULUCF;Adaptation, Economic Development, Environmental Protection, Mitigation;Trade-oriented

This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transport; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include: 1) Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation; 2) Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity; 3) Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transport and other environmentally-friendly forms of transport; 4) Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management; 5) Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, Sustainable forest policies; 6) Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues); 7) Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%; 8) Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.  The settlement includes three main targets: 1) In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10% 2) Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030 3) By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)  While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.";2011;"Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Redd+ And Lulucf;Transport";https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcjBHIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--39ec4cbbaf03ab4a85605c9c371d41ee3d2a18dc/f|;CPR;Cross-Sectoral: Direct Investment, Cross-Sectoral: Governance;Agriculture, Buildings, Energy, Food Industry, LULUCF, Transport;Air Pollution, Economic Development, Food Safety, Food Security, Mitigation;Consumer-oriented, Producer-oriented

The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br /> <br /> The plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br /> - Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br /> - Low carbon transport<br /> - Low carbon industry<br /> - Low carbon electricity<br /> - Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br /> <br /> The government will support up to 1.5 million solid wall insulations and other energy efficiency measures, introduce zero-carbon home standards to support energy efficiency improvements. It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br /> <br /> The government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br /> Emissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development.<br /> <br /> By 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027.<br /> <br /> The Plan envisages significant reductions in methane emissions from landfill by 2050, as part of the move towards a zero waste economy.;2011;"Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transport";https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBc0FIIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--98136901dc4939a48b5e3e0d969e2030fad70d4a/f|;CPR;Sectoral: Market-based;Agriculture, Buildings, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, Food Industry, LULUCF, Transport, Waste;Air Pollution, Economic Development, Food Security, Food Waste, Mitigation, Nutrition and Health;Consumer-oriented, Producer-oriented, Trade-oriented

409;1777;Clean Air Act;United States of America;US;USA;Country;"The Clean Air Act is a federal law designed to control air pollution on a National level. It requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop and enforce regulations to protect the general public from exposure to airborne contamints that are known to be hazardous to human health and/or welfare.  Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for statiory sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes: - National Ambient Air Quality Standards (AQS) - EPA was required to promulgate National standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation) - State Implementation Plans (SIPs) - New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) - National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)  The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.  Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection. The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect.   The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and statiory sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011. Standards for mobile sources have been established. The EPA also promulgated <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/statiory-sources-air-pollution/clean-air-act-standards-and-guidelines-electric-utilities"">standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants</a> and from other statiory sources. <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/statiory-sources-air-pollution/nsps-ghg-emissions-new-modified-and-reconstructed-electric-utility"">New Source Performance Standards</a> from new, modified and reconstructed power plants were reinstated by the Biden administration in March 2021. Public Law no 117-23 was signed by President Biden on June 30th, 2021, to cancel the rule submitted by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by the Trump administration on September 14th, 2020 to roll back restrictions on methane emissions in the oil and gas sector (85 Fed.

410;2002;Law no. 2015-992 on Energy Transition for Green Growth (Energy Transition Law);France;FR;FRA;Country;"The framework Energy Transition Law and its related action plans are designed to give France the means to diversify its energy mix and enhance its actions contributing to tackling climate change. It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious National targets:     cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;</li> cut the National energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;</li> reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;</li> cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;</li> bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030.</li></ul> The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of 14.5 euros to 56 euros per ton in 2020, and 100 euros in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget. Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194). The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy). The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of commul parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tents (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).  The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). AddiNational measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); pelties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).  The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial  risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and instituNational investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and Governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the fincing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educaNational and financial  assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others.  The law also promotes waste reduction and resources savings, in particular a gradual decoupling between France's growth and consumption of raw materials. The laws includes the following provisions:    increase by 30% over 2010-2030, the ratio of the GDP to domestic material consumption;</li> decrease the domestic material consumption per capita (consumer products, food waste, electronic waste) and increase recycling rates (art 70-V, art 84, art 87, art 99 and 103);</li> the production, distribution, sale, provision and use of packaging or bags made wholly or partly from oxo-fragmentable plastic (biodegradable but not compostable) are prohibited;</li> as of 1 January 2016, disposable plastic bags available at supermarket counters are prohibited, and from 1 January 2017, the ""fruit and vegetables"" plastic bags are prohibited (art 75);</li> as of 1 January 2017, the use of non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic packaging for sending addressed or non-addressed press and advertising is prohibited ;</li> state services and local authorities are to decrease their office paper consumption by 30% before 2020;</li> as of 1 January 2017, at least 25% (40% as of 1 January 2020) of paper products, stationery and fiber-based prints acquired by state services and local authorities and their groupings are to be made from recycled paper, with the rest to come from Sustainably maged forests;</li> strengthened powers for mayors to deal with abandoned vehicles (art 77);</li> better monitoring of waste (art 82) and fight against chemical waste trafficking (art 77-IV) and unregulated waste disposal (art 78);</li> other quantified limits apply to State and local authorities construction work waste and raw materials use.</li></ul>  The law also aims to support protection of biodiversity and pollution reduction, in particular through mandated reduction of free sale of pesticides for home-gardeners (from 1 January 2016) and then phase-out from 1 January 2017, and ban on aerial spraying of pesticides, except in cases of serious health hazard (art 68).  On July 27th, 2022, a decision was issued regarding the development of two offshore wind farm projects in the South Atlantic Ocean. The decision states that public consultation processes for both projects will take place starting in 2022; both wind farms will have capacities of 1000 MW and will be situated outside of the Gironde and Pertuis marine estuaries but within France's exclusive economic zone.

412;2006;Act 1990:582 on Carbon Tax and related regulations;Sweden;SE;SWE;Country;"The Carbon Tax Act (as amended in 2013) introduced carbon tax on coal, oil, natural gas, petrol, and aviation fuel used in domestic travel, complementing the already existing energy taxes, aiming at supporting development of cleaner fuels while keeping the burden on the energy sector more or less constant. Initially covering the whole of the above sectors, the tax was reformed after the launch of the EU carbon-trading scheme and was kept for industry and non-industry emitters outside of the EU ETS scheme. Initially set at a general level of USD120 per ton of CO2 (different rates for coal fuels, kerosene and engine oils on domestic flights, natural gas, and LPG) - the carbon tax was progressively raised in 2013 to USD349 per tonne of CO2 for coal fuels and up to USD418 per tonne of CO2 for natural gas used for non-travel purposes for the sectors still concerned by the tax. Both peat and biofuels are exempt from the tax, as well as fuels used for electricity production. Until 2015, minor tax relief was also granted for natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) used in cars, ships, and aircraft; however, from 2015 the same level of tax will apply to all fossil fuels. AddiNationally, EU ETS exempt industries such as agriculture, forestry and pisciculture are subject to 30% of the standard CO2 tax. <a href=""https://www.government.se/498550/globalassets/government/bilder/finsdepartementet/carbon-taxes/220422-carbon-tax-sweden---general-info.pdf"">In 2019</a>, the Swedish government increased chemical tax, abolished a tax reduction for diesel in mining, increased energy and carbon taxation on fuels in certain heat production. <a href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/37455"">According to a World Bank report</a>, ""the annual adjustment by gross domestic product has been paused for 2021 and 2022 for gasoline and diesel"".";2013;"Carbon Pricing;Energy Supply";https://climate-laws.org/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBaUVJIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--df4b65ca3f357ec1d241637c43366215bcbd6cb4/f|;CPR;Sectoral: Market-based, Sectoral: Non Market-based;Agriculture, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, Food Industry, LULUCF, Transport;Air Pollution, Economic Development, Mitigation;Producer-oriented
413;2009;Act on Biocomponents and Liquid Biofuels (Dz.U. 2006 nr 169 poz. 1199);Poland;PL;POL;Country;"This Act (last amended in January 2015) establishes that the producers, importers and suppliers of fuels are obliged to meet an annual quota of biofuels in the total amount of liquid fuels produced, supplied and imported. The obligation levels are determined every three years for a period of six years by the Council of Ministers.  The following biocomponents are eligible: bioethanol, biomethanol, biobutanol, ester dimethylether, pure vegetable oil, bio liquid hydrocarbons, bio propane-butane, liquefied biomethane, compressed biomethane and biohydrogen, which are produced from biomass for use in the manufacture of liquid fuels or biofuels (art. 2 par. 1 no. 3). The biocomponents and bioliguids can only count towards the quota and be eligible for financial  support, if they meet the Sustainability criteria set out within the recognized certification system (art. 28b-28c) approved by the European Commission, including GHG emission reduction, protection of land with high biodiversity value, peatland protection and Sustainable farming criteria (art. 28a).  The Act is detailed by Regulation of 23 July 2013 on the National Indicative Targets for 2013-2018).

414;2010;Act on Renewable Energy Sources ('RES Act', Dz.U. 2015 poz. 478);Poland;PL;POL;Country;"This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020. The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO). The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of pelty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odwialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power). The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply:     support for max 15 years from the start of renewable energy production in the given installation;</li> support for hydropower of max 5 MW of capacity;</li> support for biomass co-firing installations of less than 150 MW capacity capped to equivalent of the average generation over 2011-2013;</li> large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 €/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.</li></ul></li></ul>  The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called ‘prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business. The Act was amended in June 2018, alongside the 2016 Act on investments in wind power and the 1994 Construction Act, in order to boost offshore wind investment. It was further amended in August 2019 to extend the agreements on grid connection and updates the auction mechanism.

The Strategy comes in line with the commitment made under the 2008 Climate Change Act that requires the country to reduce its emissions ""by at least 80% by 2050"". The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032). Beyond setting up the strategy to 2032, the document explores electrification, hydrogen and emissions removal as three pathways to 2050.  The Strategy firstly highlights the image of leadership and situation of progress that the country has made in the last two decades. It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial  industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and ""could deliver between £60 billion and £170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030"". The document also mentions the co-benefits of actions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions on local air quality, public health, the economy and the environment. The Strategy also recalls the objective of energy affordability and the fact that leaving the EU represents an opportunity as ""domestic binding emissions targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation"".  A number of more precise objectives are detailed as following: 1) develop green finance capabilities, including by setting up a green finance taskforce and providing up to £20 million to support a new clean technology early stage investment fund,- 2) develop a package of measures to support businesses to improve their energy productivity, by at least 20% by 2030,- 3) improving energy efficiency and aiming at reducing emissions from homes by 19% and energy use by 9%,- 4) rolling out low carbon heating,- 5) accelerate the shift to low carbon transport and reduce emissions by 29% by relying mostly on electric vehicles,- 6) deliver clean, smart, flexible power,- 7)enhance the benefits and value of domestic natural resources,- 8) and lead in the public sector.

452;9452;Economic stimulus package;Germany;DE;DEU;Country;"Germany's 130 billion euro stimulus package deals with climate change action in several ways.   First, it ensures federal support to the fincing of local public transport. To this end, the federal government will increase the Regionalisation funds once by 2.5 billion euros this year. The federal government will also increase its share from the current 40% from January 1, 2021 to 50% for costs from the GDR's supplementary pension systems.  In order to promote Sustainable mobility, the future package includes several measures for the mobility transition. It aims to accompany the structural change in the automotive industry and to help build Sustainable value chains. These include the following changes: - As an “innovation bonus”, the federal government will double its share of the environmental bonus until December 31, 2021. When purchasing an electric vehicle with a list price of up to 40,000 euros, the federal funding increases from 3,000 to 6,000 euros. - An addiNational 2.5 billion euros will be invested in the expansion of modern and secure charging station infrastructure and the promotion of research and development in the field of electromobility and battery cell production. - Future investments by manufacturers and suppliers in the automotive industry will be supported with a bonus program in 2020 and 2021 with 1 billion euros. - The car tax will be more geared to CO2 emissions from 2021, making clean cars cheaper to pay than high-emission models. - Electromobility is to be promoted with limited fleet exchange programs. This affects vehicles for social services in city traffic as well as electric utility vehicles for craftsmen and small and medium-sized companies. There will also be a doubling of the purchase subsidy until 2021, tax exemption for electric vehicles, obligations for petrol stations to offer charging points, support for automakers conditioned to green investments,  - The federal government is investing in a bus and truck fleet modernization program that supports alternative drives. The funding for e-buses and their charging infrastructure will be increased until the end of 2021. - In order to promote cleaner trucks in heavy goods traffic, the federal government is campaigning for a Europe-wide exchange program for heavy commercial vehicles with grants for the exchange of old Euro 3 to 5 vehicles for new Euro VI vehicles. - Deutsche Bahn receives addiNational equity of 5 billion euros from the federal government. In this way, it can also invest in the modernization, expansion and electrification of the rail network, as well as in the rail system, given the loss of revenue due to coro. - Extra funding to the aviation industry is conditioned to making new planes more fuel-savvy. - a fund for shipping will also require improvements in fuel efficiency.  The federal government is further launching an <a href=""https://climate-laws.org/cclow/geographies/germany/policies/National-hydrogen-strategy-nws"">investment package to promote hydrogen technology</a>. This should also lay the foundation for new export technologies and pave the way for greenhouse gas neutrality in heavy goods traffic in industry.  The federal government is granting a subsidy to lower the EEG surcharge so that it will be 6.5 ct / kwh in 2021 and 6.0 ct / kwh in 2022.  The cap for the expansion of photovoltaics will be abolished and the expansion target for offshore wind energy will be raised from 15 GW to 20 GW.

In Article 1 of the law, the State reiterates its commitment to respect the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with EU 2018/842 regulation and the Paris Agreement.  Articles 7 to 22 on supervision and regulation of advertising restrict the exposure of products and services with an excessive impact on the climate, notably fossil fuels (2022) and high-polluting cars (2028). From March 1st, 2022, car manufacturers will have to display the CO2 emission class of the their vehicle in advertisements.  Transport-related measures include 1) the obligation for cities or metropolitan areas of more than 150,000 inhabitants to establish a low-emission mobility zone before December 31, 2024, 2) the banning of flights within French territory when the journey is also provided on the National rail network without a connection and by several daily connections lasting less than 2h30, and 3) grants regions the possibility to create a road ecotax from 2024. Article 133 extends until December 31, 2030, the excepNational deduction scheme that benefit companies using vehicles heavier than 2.6 tonnes and that use gas (NGV, LNG, bioNGV and bioLNG), certain types of biofuels, electricity, and hydrogen.

The PEIS will provide a vehicle for the Department to undertake a comprehensive review of the program and consider whether and how the program may be improved and modernised to foster the orderly development of BLM<strong> </strong>administered coal on Federal lands in a manner that gives proper consideration to the impact of that development on important stewardship values, while also ensuring a fair return to the American public. This Order does not apply to the coal program on Indian lands.  Under section 4.c) on the Discretionary programmatic environmental impact statement, it is stated that the PEIS should examine how best to assess the climate impacts of continued Federal coal production and combustion and how to address those impacts in the management of the program to meet both the tion's energy needs and its climate goals, as well as how best to protect the public lands from climate change impacts.  In practice, this order ebled the Obama administration to instate a moratorium of coal leases on federal lands over climate concerns. This moratorium was suspended in 2017 under the Trump administration, which led to lawsuits being filed in at least four US states. However, in August 2022, a federal judge from the United States District Court for the District of Monta ruled that the Trump administration did not properly study the environmental impacts of suspending the decision, a requirement under the National Environmental Policy Act.

It implies a small reduction in overall GHG emissions by 2020, and a 4% increase between 2020 and 2030. The document presents a sectoral strategy aiming to address the key challenges that the Polish power industry must faces until 2030, including growing demand for energy, idequate fuel, energy generation and transmission infrastructure, significant dependence on exterl supplies of natural gas and almost full complete dependence on exterl supplies of crude oil, as well as commitments in the field of environmental protection, including climate protection. The new Energy Policy for Poland until 2050, which will reflect the decisions made on the EU 2030 climate policy, is under preparation.  The document establishes a number of measures addressing energy demand, including National energy efficiency targets, energy efficiency performance certificates, minimum standards for power-consuming products, supporting investments in energy saving, and applying demand-side management techniques.  It also establishes that energy supply should consist of a mix between cogeneration, renewables, grid modernisation, and nuclear. With this end, the EPP fixes measurable targets, for example: increase the percentage of renewable energy sources to 15% by 2020 and to 20% by 2030; boost the share of biofuels in the transport fuels market to 10%; and building of at least one biogas agricultural plant in each commune by 2020.  The EPP 2030 strategy document establishes the need to gradually increase the share of bio-components fuel in transport fuels so as to meet planned objectives. As a result, the government established differentiated fuel taxes in a way that to promotes alternative fuels.  PEP 2040 was officially released on September 8, 2020. It amends PEP 2030 and mandates a progressive phase-out of hard coal and lignite, investments in nuclear and renewable energy sources.";2021;"Institutions , Administrative Arrangements;Research And Development;Energy Supply;Energy Demand;Transport;coal phase out;fossil fuels curbing measures;Limits on fossil fuels";https://cpr-prod-cclw-document-admin-store.s3.eu-west-1.amazows.com/Energy_Policy_of_Poland_until_2040%20%281%29.docx;CPR;Cross-Sectoral: Governance;Agriculture, Buildings, Economy-wide (Multi-sector), Energy, Industry, Transport;Economic Development, Environmental Protection, Food Security, Mitigation;Producer-oriented
